# IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview:
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of top IMDb movies. The dataset is generated by scraping IMDb's top movies and extracting user reviews for each movie. The sentiment analysis is performed using a random forest classifier.

## Files in this Repository:
1. `data_generation.py`: Python script to scrape IMDb top movies and extract user reviews.
2. `data_analysis.py`: Python script to perform data analysis, visualization, sentiment analysis, model training, and evaluation.
3. `dataset.csv`: CSV file containing the scraped data, including movie titles and user reviews.
4. `README.md`: Detailed information about the project, its purpose, findings, and instructions.

## Findings:
- The dataset consists of user reviews for top IMDb movies.
- Distribution of review lengths varies across different movies.
- Word cloud visualization highlights the most frequent words used in the reviews.
- The sentiment analysis model achieved an accuracy of X%.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `data_generation.py` to generate the dataset (`dataset.csv`).
4. Run `data_analysis.py` to perform data analysis, visualization, sentiment analysis, model training, and evaluation.
5. Review the findings and model performance in the README file.

## Future Work:
- Improve data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis.
- Deploy the sentiment analysis model for real-time predictions.
